                 expect that Items that are not near one another in a plan are not related. Apple.com site totally shows that
                 how a closeness standard should resemble the other the same. The Image of iPhone Se and text give us overall information 
                 when they are placed together.Now We have a general idea that the Image is of iPhone Se its price and
                 if we want to trade-in or not. </p>

                lined up with one another so we as a client get a sorted outlook and comprehend what it does. Moroever, by observing the picture we can
                comprehend this is a site for freelancing and we can recruit or work as talent.</p>
